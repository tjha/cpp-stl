# cpp-stl
This C++ library emulates data structures and functions found in the STL. It's
purpose is to provide myself with a platform from which I can relearn basic
concepts I had learned during my introductory CS courses in university to
reinforce my understandings of how the STL works under-the-hood. With the
confidence I gain from a deep understanding of this repo, I will utilize it as a
submodule in various other projects I work on. This repo will be updated over
time with more data structures and optimizations.
